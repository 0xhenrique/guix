* Why? :TOC:
Why not?

* Dependencies :TOC:

* Installing :TOC:
Backup or delete your current .emacs.d directory and clone this repo:
#+BEGIN_SRC
  git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/henrique-marques-vsoft/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC
Simple as that. But if you're not using EXWM I recommend that you read further.

* How to remove unwanted things :TOC:
There's a file called =init.el= where you can simply comment or delete some of the lisp/modules.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; If you're not an EXWM enjoyer, you can remove or comment the line below
(require 'pache-ui)
(require 'pache-exwm)
;; If you're not an Evil enjoyer, you might also want to remove pache-evil below
(require 'pache-evil)
(require 'pache-misc)
(require 'pache-yas)
(require 'pache-programming)
(require 'pache-irc)
#+END_SRC

Beware that some of those modules are required to run Pachemacs.
Be careful when removing it.
There is a github issue to track this problem. You can check it [[https://github.com/henrique-marques-vsoft/emacs.d/issues/2][here]].

* How to create new modules :TOC:
Create a new file:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  touch ~/.emacs.d/lisp/pache-module.el
#+END_SRC

Add the following boilerplate to the newly created module:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;;; pache-module.el --- Custom Module Settings -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
  ;;; Commentary:
  ;;; Code:


  (provide 'pache-module)
  ;;; pache-module.el ends here
#+END_SRC

And call it in the =init.el= file like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'pache-module)
#+END_SRC

* How to customise the Dashboard :TOC:
The settings for the Dashboard can be found at =~/.emacs.d/lisp/pache-ui.el=.
Search for the following block: 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package dashboard
  :ensure t
  :config
  (dashboard-setup-startup-hook)
  (setq dashboard-startup-banner "~/.emacs.d/img/pache-5.png"
	dashboard-banner-logo-title "P A C H E M A C S"
	dashboard-footer-messages '("\"The shrine isn't a good place for using magic.\"")
	dashboard-center-content t
	dashboard-vertically-center-content t
	dashboard-items '((recents . 8)
			  (bookmarks . 5)
			  (projects . 3)
			  (agenda . 3))))
